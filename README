Linux Completely Fair Scheduling

> The input process file must be named: "processes", and placed in the same folder as the C program.

All algorithm as one
1. To Compile: 
   - make
2. To Execute: 
   - make exe

Each algorithm separately
1. To Compile: 
   - make FCFS
   - make SJF
   - make RR
2. To Execute:
   - ./FCFS
   - ./SFJ
   - ./RR

Additional command
- To Execute with Valgrind:
  - make valgrind
- To Clean Up: 
  - make clean

Program output
- FCFS -> FCFS.txt
- SJF -> SJF.txt
- RR -> RR.txt

Content: A table with 6 columns
- I: Process Iterator (start from 0 != PID) (For looping purpose)
- B: Burst Time
- A: Arrival Time
- C: Completion Time
- T: Turn Around Time
- W: Waiting Time

Main Scheduling Algorithm:
- FCFS: in method fcfs() in FCFS.c
- SJF: in method sjf() in SJF.c
- RR: in method rr() in RR.c
